        <h1>I'm Still Standing</h1>
        <h4>by Elton John</h4>
        <p>You could never know what it's like <br>
           Your blood like winter freezes just like ice <br>
           And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you <br>
           You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use</p>
        <p>Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did <br>
           Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid <br>
           I'm still standing after all this time <br>
           Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind</p>
